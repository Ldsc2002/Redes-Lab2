When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science

Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again

Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life

Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual

Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, Son when you grow up,
Would you be the savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned?
He said Will you defeat them,
Your demons, and all the non-believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
If I can't let you go, will darkness divide?
For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies
We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost
Now the only way out's in your heart-shaped box
But I hate that it seemed you were never enough
We were broken and bleeding but never gave up
And I hate that I made you the enemy
And I hate that your heart was the casualty
Now I hate that I need you
As we rest here alone like notes on a page
The finest to compose could not play our pain
With a candle through time I can still see your ghost
But I can't close my eyes, for it
for it is there where you haunt me most
where you haunt me most
Praying for what your heart brings
Thoughts of escape and bloodshot eyes
You're barely sleeping
No longer dreaming
Now what you do to feel alive
Rise up and celebrate your life
We're not alone in our ritual
Sing for what you feel inside
Become one with your ritual
From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected
Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark, silent through the night
The witches join the fight
Never miss their mark, canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment, 588
Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory, tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected, stealth perfected
As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong
Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall
Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat
Into the motherland the German army march
In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack
Once the battle started there's no turning back
The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war, the Soviet wrath unleashed
Fields of Prokhorovka, where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses, and the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans, fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia, out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line, force the Axis to retreat
Sending all the reserves, securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union, broke the citadel
Ruins of an army, Axis rest in hell
Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The Western front and all the way to Russia
Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher
Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise
And he's flying higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come

Higher, an eye for an eye,
The legend will never die
A long ago in eastern Prussia
Young men with great ambitions rise
So who can tell me who can say for sure
Which one will win the Nobel Prize?
It was a golden age for science
The kaiserreich would hold the key
And as the conflict came and tensions rose
The manifest of the 93
Haber-Bosch, the great alliance
Where's the contradiction?
Fed the world by ways of science
Sinner or a saint?
Father of toxic gas and chemical warfare
His dark creation has been revealed
Flow over no man's land, a poisonous nightmare
A deadly mist on the battlefield
Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back
And that's when the dead men are marching again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the led once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again
Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart
I tell you, I tell you, the dragonborn comes
With a voice wielding power of the ancient nord art
Believe, believe, the dragonborn comes
It's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes
Beware, beware, the dragonborn comes
For the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows
You'll know, you'll know the dragonborn's come
